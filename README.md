# Eventbrite-API-Implementation
Two ways to implement Eventbrite APIs, using JS, Ajax and PHP. 

Features: <br>
1. List upcoming available events in a table, including date, title, start time, end time, organizer and link to register. <br>
2. List organizers under the user account. <br>
3. Support event filtering for each organizer.<br>
4. Support searching events according to user input. <br>
5. Support comprehensive searching in selected organizer's events.<br>
6. Using Ajax to send requests and receive responses.<br>
7. Using php to do logics. <br>
8. Loading alert for users when waiting responses. <br>
